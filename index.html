        <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Capitals is a simple geography game for the iPhone written in <code>Objective-C</code> (of course!). Its completely open source and I wrote it as a learning experience.</p>

<h3>The Math (and the Problem)</h3>

<p>Capitals uses a list of 250 countries and is a true or false game. So, the chance of the answer being <code>False</code> is <code>249/250</code> → the chance of it being <code>True</code> is <code>(250-249)/250 = 1/250</code>. This means that its much faster to keep pressing the false button than it is to actually think whether the country and capitals are a match. As I said, I just wrote it as a learning experience.</p>

<p>It will not provide a significant challenge.</p>
