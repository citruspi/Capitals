### Capitals

Capitals is a simple geography game for the iPhone written in Objective-C (of course!). Its completely open source and I wrote it as a learning experience.

### The Math (and the Problem)

Capitals uses a list of 250 countries and is a true or false game. So, the chance of the answer being "false" is 249/250. The chance of it being "true" is 1/250. What does this mean? 

Its much faster to keep pressing the false button than it is to actually think whether the country and capitals are a match. As I said, I just wrote it as a learning experience.
