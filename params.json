Its completely open source and I wrote it as a learning experience.\r\n\r\n### The Math (and the Problem)\r\n\r\nCapitals uses a list of 250 countries and is a true or false game. So, the chance of the answer being \"false\" is 249/250. The chance of it being \"true\" is 1/250. What does this mean? \r\n\r\nIts much faster to keep pressing the false button than it is to actually think whether the country and capitals are a match. As I said, I just wrote it as a learning experience.\r\n\r\n### Screen Shot\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/fO55Q.png)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe graphics are from, as usual, the awesome [Premium Pixels](http://premiumpixels.com).
